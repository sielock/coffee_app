# As a coffee enthusiast, having a way to keep track of the different varieties of coffee beans, preparation methods, and other coffee-related information would very useful. So I wanted to make a webapp that can fulill these use cases, and hopefully many more down the road. Initially, this will be a fairly simple project, a website built using HTML5, CSS3, vanilla Javascript, and possibly Bootstrap and/or SASS. Once I get the basic functionality implemented and I am satisfied with the way it looks and runs, I would like to use Apache Cordova to turn it into a multi-platform app. But that is a challenge for another day :)
